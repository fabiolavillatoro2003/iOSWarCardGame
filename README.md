# iOSWarCardGame
Hi! This is my first ever iOS project. I used SwiftUI to create a War Card game. 

When the deal button on the UI is pressed, a card for both the player and CPU is randomly generated and compared. 

The higher card wins!

I give all credit to Code With Chris on YouTube. I followed his walk-through iOS tutorial. 
Now I embark on another project with the skills I've gained!
